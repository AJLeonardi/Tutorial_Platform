This code encompasses two Chrome Extensions:
1.) an extension which allows you to create jQuery Tours/Tutorials for any website (stored on a hosted server)
2.) an extension which shows whether there are any tutorials for the site you're viewing, if so, you can choose one and take it

This also has the server-side code available.

See the documentation for set up details.

Current support end user side:
-  popovers on elements which have IDs
-  modal windows that display hosted content: e.g. youtube videos, or links to html documents
-  css changes to elements which have IDs

Current support author side:
- add popovers to <a> elements which have IDs
- add pre-defined css classes to <a> elements which have IDs
- add modal window which display hosted content: e.g. youtube videos, or links to html documents, or straight text
	- to do this, you'll have to select a highlighted <a> element -- no change will be made to that element in the case of a modal window (it's just a way to get to the popup)
- define title in Header, and also "quit" which refreshes screen

Current Server Side Arch:
- one table in MySQL server
- PHP to query DB with passed params
- PHP creates and returns XML as a response


##### Need to turn below into Issues in GitHub  #######

To Dos:
- CLEAN UP CODE like whoa
- End User:
	- clean up popup.html //in progress -- should probably have more data about tutorials -- like description, author, etc...
		- possibly get rid of the popup.html entirely, and do it more like the evernote extension.

- Author Side:
	- add support for elements that do not have IDs -- need to be able to uniquely Select an element based on info from the DB -- Currently this isn't working for undefined IDs (see El Universal -- getting #Undefined as a selector)
		- currently have implemented the ":contains()" selector to do this a bit. need to make it smarter though.
	- clean up User Interaction to add modal window
	- make better tutorial authoring tool -- so can view tutorial "tree" and re-organize steps -- keep track of steps with multiple items (e.g. a css change and a popover).
	- landing page where user can Test/Edit Existing tutorials, and another option to add new (so they don't have to have two extensions installed)
	- change background page to event page: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages.html
	- assemble the tutorial on client instead of adding each step to the DB immediately. Store it, and post it all in one go when user hits "save" or something.

- Server Side:
	- Create JSON api instead of XML 
	- possibly create more robust DB structure
	- get tutorial needs to get by name AND url!!! (otherwise can't have tutorials with same name on different urls)
- General:
	- CSS Themes for tutorials themselves
	- create non-stolen icons
	- Parameterize things like Server Address, so that you don't need to dive into the code to make many changes.
	- Parameterize the server side info -- DB name/pw/etc??
- Bugs:
	- intermittent issue where submit step to DB with "order" value "0" -- which breaks the tutorial at that point.
